Programming Questions:
Explore one data set and perform all the operations from descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis
Identify outliers in the given dataset
Z-Score Method: The Z-score indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. If the Z-score is greater than a certain threshold (typically 3 or -3), the point is considered an outlier.
IQR (Interquartile Range) Method: The IQR method calculates the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Outliers are typically defined as points outside the range [Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR].
Box Plot Method: Box plots visually represent the distribution of data and highlight outliers as points outside the "whiskers" of the plot, which typically represent the 1.5 * IQR range.
